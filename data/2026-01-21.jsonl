We demonstrate that astrometry enables access to complementary information through photocentre variations induced by rotating surface features. The forthcoming commissioning of microarcsecond-precision astrometric missions presents an opportunity to improve stellar surface mapping. This paper extends a previous theoretical framework for stellar surface mapping, along three primary directions: (1) we derive analytical selection rules showing that astrometry is sensitive to spherical harmonic modes not detectable via photometry, particularly odd-$\\ell$ modes that encode north-south asymmetries; (2) we quantify the information content of combined photometric and astrometric observations, showing that the rank of observable modes grows faster for combined observations than for either technique alone, though the fraction of recoverable modes still decreases asymptotically with increasing spatial resolution; and (3) we reframe astrometric jitter-traditionally treated as noise in exoplanet studies-as a signal encoding stellar surface structure. Given the limited proposed target lists of high-precision astrometric missions, this capability is particularly valuable: understanding host star surfaces is crucial for both removing stellar signals from exoplanet detections and characterising star-planet interactions. We show that while Sun-like stars require sub-microarcsecond precision, evolved stars with angular diameter and larger spots present immediate opportunities with current technology, such as the Gaia mission."}

Hero"], "title": "Using Astrometry to Break Degeneracies in Stellar Surface Mapping", "comment": "Submitted to ApJ", "summary": "Astrometric jitter noise arises when starspots on a rotating stellar surface move in and out of view, shifting the photocenter. This noise may limit our ability to detect and weigh small, sub-Neptune-sized planets around active stars. By deriving a linear forward model for the astrometric jitter signal of a rotating star in a spherical-harmonic coordinate system, we show that jitter noise can be used to reconstruct surface-brightness maps and, in principle, disentangle jitter from stellar reflex motion due to an orbiting planet. Furthermore, we show that astrometry and photometry probe complementary surface information: photometry measures even-degree spherical harmonic surfaces that are symmetric about the equator, while astrometry measures odd-degree modes. Their joint use, therefore, breaks degeneracies in surface mapping. Our model further quantifies the variation in the astrometric signal with inclination angle, which is foundational for studies of worst-case configurations of astrometric star-spot noise. For example, we show that pole-on stellar inclinations lead to poorly constrained inversions, as any stellar surface produces a purely circular astrometric jitter signal. We characterize the degeneracy in jointly identifying the stellar surface and stellar inclination, and develop a surface estimation approach. Using this approach, we present example simulations and reconstructions that demonstrate the use of astrometry data alongside light-curve data to improve stellar surface mapping and localize spot positions in latitude and longitude. With forthcoming high-precision Gaia astrometry, astrometric surface mapping provides a promising new approach to probe stellar activity."}

The coronal X-ray activity of HD 166620 has so far only been probed with a ROSAT/HRI observation in 1996, near the chromospheric activity maximum before the star entered its grand minimum around 2004. We conducted a deep {\\it XMM-Newton} observation of HD 166620 during its chromospheric Ca II H&K activity grand minimum to achieve a better understanding of its magnetic activity. We detected HD 166620 with an X-ray luminosity of ${{\\rm log}\\,L_{\\rm X}\\,\\rm{(erg\\,s^{-1})}=26.56^{+0.10}_{-0.12}}$, corresponding to ${{\\rm log}\\,(L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm bol}) = -6.58^{+0.10}_{-0.12}}$ and an X-ray surface flux of log Fx (erg/cm^2/s) = 3.97+0.10-0.12. With respect to the earlier ROSAT observation, the X-ray brightness of HD 166620 has decreased by a factor of 2.5 during its Maunder minimum-like state. To place its X-ray properties into context, we constructed an X-ray sample of late-type stars within 10 pc of the Sun. The activity of HD 166620 is below the levels of all other K dwarfs in the 10 pc sample. The corona of HD 166620 during its grand minimum emits at the level of the solar background corona, which implies that it has no large active magnetic structures. Along with long-term Ca II H&K monitoring of HD 166620, this result provides evidence that the solar activity during the Maunder minimum was not reduced significantly below the levels seen during its present-day cycle minima. The similar X-ray surface flux of HD 166620 and the modern quiet Sun, and also their Rossby number near the critical value of spin-down models, suggest a connection between the regime of weakened magnetic braking and the occurrence of Maunder minimum states."}

The observed thinness of the tachocline is a long-standing dynamical puzzle because the tachocline should have spread significantly due to inward-burrowing meridional circulation, also called \"radiative spreading.\" We recently presented the first pair of global simulations to reveal a statistically stationary tachocline confined against radiative spreading by the Maxwell stresses from the nonaxisymmetric modes of a dynamo, which penetrated into and below the tachocline through a novel magnetic skin effect. In the work presented here, we systematically examine how this \"dynamo confinement scenario\" works against radiative spreading in a suite of simulations as the governing parameters trend in the direction of the true solar regime. We find that as the stable stratification of the radiative zone is made progressively stronger, the dynamo cycles get longer, the magnetic field consequently penetrates deeper due to the skin effect, and the tachocline becomes more confined. Furthermore, these results have interesting consequences for solar spin-down. In all of our radiatively spreading simulations, the tachocline region spins down due to the burrowing circulation. Below the tachocline, the Maxwell stresses transmit this spin-down further to rigidify the deeper radiative zone. We thus speculate that, in addition to confining the tachocline, the dynamo may provide a pathway to communicate spin-down from the near-surface layers to the deep interior."}

Following Sun et al., we applied Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, identifying $\\sim$240,000 spectra with potential H$α$ emission.

From the remaining 51 candidates, we classified 26 with strong infrared excess as new HAeBes. Color-index analysis of confirmed HAeBes and classical Ae/Be stars (CAeBes) revealed that the $(K-W1)_0$ vs. $(W2-W3)_0$ diagram effectively separates these populations: CAeBes predominantly occupy $(K-W1)_0 \\leq 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 \\leq 1.1$, while other regions trace transition disks ($(K-W1)_0 < 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 > 1.1$), globally depleted disks ($(K-W1)_0 > 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 < 1.1$), and Class I/Flat/II HAeBes ($(K-W1)_0 > 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 > 1.1$). More importantly, the HAeBes exhibit a clear evolutionary gradient on this diagram, with those in the Class III, Class II, Flat-SED, and Class I evolutionary stages being effectively distinguished by concentric ellipses that are roughly centered at (0,0) with semi-major axes of $a$=1.5, $a$=3.0, and $a$=4.0, and a semi-major to semi-minor axis ratio of 1.6:1."}

We focus on spectral analysis and plasma instability analysis, using ion-scale normalized magnetic helicity and polarization properties with respect to the background magnetic field $B_0$. In the first interval, the ion-scale normalized magnetic helicity shows a left-handed circularly polarized signature. In the second interval, the left-handed signature persists and an additional high-frequency right-handed population appears. The propagation is approximately parallel to $B_0$. The left-handed fluctuations are compatible with Alfvén ion-cyclotron (AIC) waves, while the right-handed fluctuations are consistent with fast magnetosonic/whistler (FM/W) waves. The ICME plasma accesses resonance conditions that support multiple ion-scale wave modes. Evolving anisotropies in the plasma and the approach to marginal stability allow the coexistence of AIC-like and fast-magnetosonic/whistler-like fluctuations, with enhanced electron heating favoring the growth of the FM/W contribution and strengthening the density--magnetic-field magnitude correlation."}

With the mounting evidence for the importance of studying magnetic fields in interacting massive binary and multiple systems, it appears necessary to investigate the presence of magnetic fields in semi-detached systems with ongoing mass transfer, and in contact systems where mass is actively being exchanged. We present an analysis of 53 high-resolution HARPSpol spectropolarimetric observations of a sample of 14 massive binary and multiple systems using the least-squares deconvolution technique. The majority of the studied systems are classified as semi-detached or contact binaries. Definite detections of the presence of a magnetic field are achieved in all studied systems apart from the rather faint system SV Cen, for which only a marginal detection was obtained. The fact that the presence of magnetic fields is detected in all but one of the studied systems strongly suggests that interaction between the system components plays a definite role in the generation of magnetic fields in massive stars. The measured mean longitudinal magnetic field strength for all targets is of the order of a few hundred Gauss to a few kiloGauss. The strongest longitudinal magnetic fields of 4 to 5kG are discovered in the massive O-type triple system MY Ser in both components of the contact binary. kiloGauss-order magnetic fields are also detected in two other systems, V1294 Sco and V606 Cen. It is possible that there is an implication of some system characteristics, such as multiplicity, the mass ratio between the components, and a large fillout factor, on the measured magnetic field strength. Our results for the magnetic field measurements in interacting binaries present the first assessment of the occurrence rate of magnetic fields in a representative sample of such systems."}

We examine a curated sample of 22 late-T to Y dwarfs through Bayesian atmospheric retrieval (nested sampling) and supervised machine learning (random forests). Bayesian model comparison indicates that cloud-free models are generally favored for the hottest objects in the sample (T6-T8). Conversely, later-type dwarfs exhibit varying preferences, with both gray-cloud and cloud-free models providing comparable fits. The atmospheric parameters retrieved are consistent across the applied methodologies. Evidence of vertical mixing and disequilibrium chemistry is found in several objects; notably, the Y1 dwarf WISEPAJ1541-22 favors a gray cloud model and shows elevated abundances of both CO and CO2 compared to equilibrium chemistry calculations.

Based on comprehensive analysis, we conclude that they are two newly discovered binary systems, each consisting of a hot white dwarf and a flaring companion star. Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) spectra indicate that both stars contain hot white dwarfs. The spectral fitting yields $T_{eff}$=53728$\\pm$2467\\,K, log$g$=7.98$\\pm$0.08 for LAMOST J1132, and $T_{eff}$=47381$\\pm$494\\,K, log$g$=7.84$\\pm$0.05 for LAMOST J0529. The weak neutral metal lines in the LAMOST spectra and the discrepancy between the Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics (GAIA) and LAMOST spectra both indicate that these two sources are likely binary systems. The relatively high flux values for both sources in the near-infrared and mid-infrared bands support our preliminary judgment. The color index in the near-infrared bands suggests that the companion star is K or M type for LAMOST J1132 and M type for LAMOST J0529. Light curve data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) indicate that the companion stars of both sources are stars exhibiting flare activity. The eclipse probability is very low, indicating that these two sources are non-eclipsing binary systems. The physics of binaries is fascinating, and future data from LAMOST Medium Resolution Spectra are expected to enable the detection of magnetic fields in these two hot white dwarfs."}

We present the first study of an asteroseismic binary system consisting of a core helium-burning red clump (RC) star and a red giant branch (RGB) star. The Kepler target KIC 10841730 is a wide binary (period $2917 \\pm 8$ d) that provides ideal conditions to test the accuracy of RC models. While prior studies of RC stars have revealed discrepancies in modelling the period spacings of mixed modes, other model parameters remain largely untested. We perform a detailed modelling analysis using individual mode frequencies and cover a large parameter space in mass, metallicity, He-abundance, mixing length, overshooting, and mass-loss, and we also explore different methods to correct for surface effects. We find two possible results for the red clump models. One solution requires introducing an unexpected offset of the phase shift in the red clump model, yielding an age consistent with the companion star and current masses of $1.01 \\pm 0.06$ and $1.08 \\pm 0.06$ M$_\\odot$ for the RC and RGB star, respectively. Alternatively, we find that excluding the identification of two questionable radial modes resolves the phase-shift offset issue but results in a higher mass and thus a much younger age for the red clump star, contradicting the age obtained from its companion. We conclude that uncertainties in red clump models affect not only the g-mode period spacings but also the properties of the p modes. We show the power of asteroseismic binaries in validating and constraining stellar models and highlight the need for refining red-clump models."}

Understanding the survival and orbital evolution of brown dwarf (BD) companions during the post-main-sequence (MS) evolution of their host stars is increasingly important, especially with recent discoveries of many substellar companions around white dwarfs (WDs). Aims. We investigate the long-term evolution and final outcomes of BDs orbiting low-mass MS stars as these evolve into WDs. By comparing forward-modeling populations with observed WD-BD binaries, we test evolutionary models and predict the existence of yet-undetected systems. Methods. We employ the COMPAS binary population synthesis code to evolve observed MS-BD systems through the post-MS phases of their host stars into the WD stage, tracking orbital changes driven by mass loss, tides, and common-envelope (CE) evolution. Results. Our simulations reproduce a period gap in the distribution of detached WD-BD binaries, consistent with observations. We also identify a boundary separating detached and semi-detached systems on the period-mass diagram, located at orbital periods of $\\sim$1-2 hours depending on the BD mass. Conclusions. We predict that a subset of currently known MS-BD binaries will survive post-MS evolution and emerge as detached WD-BD systems, while others will undergo CE evolution and potentially form cataclysmic variables with BD donors. Our results reproduce the observed period gap in WD-BD binaries and provide quantitative predictions for the role of CE efficiency in shaping their distribution. This work predicts that many WD-BD systems remain undetected, motivating targeted searches with microlensing and high-contrast imaging techniques using next-generation large telescopes."}

Our work demonstrates, for the first time, the successful application of the light-travel time effect in a pulsating variable to unveil a dormant black hole, establishing a novel method for BH detection in non-interacting binaries."}

Building on established Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based approaches for forecasting the continuum intensity decrease associated with AR emergence, this work expands the modeling with new architectures and targets. We investigate a sliding-window Transformer architecture to forecast continuum intensity evolution up to 12 hours ahead using data from 46 ARs observed by SDO/HMI. We conduct a systematic ablation study to evaluate two key components: (1) the inclusion of a temporal 1D convolutional (Conv1D) front-end and (2) a novel `Early Detection' architecture featuring attention biases and a timing-aware loss function. Our best-performing model, combining the Early Detection architecture without the Conv1D layer, achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.1189 (representing a 10.6% improvement over the LSTM baseline) and an average advance warning time of 4.73 hours (timing difference of -4.73h), even under a stricter emergence criterion than previous studies. While the Transformer demonstrates superior aggregate timing and accuracy, we note that this high-sensitivity detection comes with increased variance compared to smoother baseline models. However, this volatility is a necessary trade-off for operational warning systems: the model's ability to detect micro-changes in precursor signals enables significantly earlier detection, outweighing the cost of increased noise. Our results demonstrate that Transformer architectures modified with early detection biases, when used without temporal smoothing layers, provide a high-sensitivity alternative for forecasting AR emergence that prioritizes advance warning over statistical smoothness."}

Therefore, it is crucial to detect Active Regions (ARs) before they start forming on the solar surface. This will enable the development of early-warning capabilities for upcoming space weather disturbances. For this reason, we prepared the Solar Active Region Emergence Dataset (SolARED). The dataset is derived from full-disk maps of the Doppler velocity, magnetic field, and continuum intensity, obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). SolARED includes time series of remapped, tracked, and binned data that characterize the evolution of acoustic power of solar oscillations, unsigned magnetic flux, and continuum intensity for 50 large ARs before, during, and after their emergence on the solar surface, as well as surrounding areas observed on the solar disc between 2010 and 2023. The resulting ML-ready SolARED dataset is designed to support enhancements of predictive capabilities, enabling the development of operational forecasts for the emergence of active regions. The SolARED dataset is available at https://sun.njit.edu/sarportal/, through an interactive visualization web application."}

Magnetograms were acquired with the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).\n  ARs were separated between three classes: class A - regular ARs (bipoles which follow the empirical rules compatible with the mean field dynamo theory); class B - irregular ARs (``wrong'' bipoles and multipolars); class U - unipolar sunspots. An aim of the present study is to explore time variations of a typical unsigned magnetic flux of ARs of different classes. The typical flux was acquired as the mean flux over all ARs of a given class observed during one solar rotation. The time profiles of the mean fluxes for different classes were compared.\n  We found that, except for periods of deep solar minima, the mean flux of B-class ARs always dominate that of A-class ARs, and, what is the most important, the time profile of B-class ARs is highly intermittent versus the rather smooth and quazi-constant A-class profile. Intermittency implies a direct involvement of turbulence.\n  We conclude that, through the entire active phase, the Sun is capable of producing regular moderate ARs at a quazi-constant rate along with the production of large and complex irregular ARs in the very intermittent manner. The result is the first observational evidence for the long-standing speculative assumption on the involvement of the convection zone turbulence into the regular global dynamo-process on a stage of the active regions formation."}

Since this system is a single-lined spectroscopic binary with spot-induced light curve modulations, we derived its physical parameters by combining the TESS light curves, the radial velocity curve from our observations, and the primary-star mass estimates based on three complementary methods.Our results reveal that HD 26172 is a detached binary system composed of a $1.25 \\pm 0.32 M_{\\odot}$ subgiant and a $0.63 \\pm 0.11 M_{\\odot}$ main-sequence star. The conclusion of subgiant primary is also supported by the absence of lithium absorption and no observed infrared excess. Using long-term photometry from the KWS survey, we detected a tentative stellar activity cycle of 5635 days with an amplitude of 0.04 mag in HD 26172. Additionally, we identified ten optical flare events exhibiting temporally clustered outburst behavior. The presence of a long-term activity cycle, pronounced starspot activity, and frequent optical flares makes HD 26172 a valuable laboratory for studying magnetic activity in subgiants within close binary systems."}

The shock parameters, including the normal speed, oblique angles, compression ratio, and Alfven Mach number, were derived by combining a steady-state solar-wind simulation with the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the shock surface based on multi-view observations. We compared the local shock parameters at the magnetic connecting points with in situ proton intensities and peak spectra to establish the link between shock evolution and SEP characteristics. The shock nose consistently exhibited higher particle-acceleration efficiency with the largest normal speed, compression ratio, and supercritical Alfven Mach number, while the flanks showed delayed transition to supercritical Alfven Mach number with weaker efficiency. The earliest and most rapid proton enhancement of STEREO-B correlated with efficient shock acceleration and prompt magnetic connectivity to the shock. Spectral analysis revealed that proton energy spectra were consistent with the relativistic diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) estimations. The initial shock acceleration began at about 1.4-5 Rsun and caused the widespread longitudinal SEP distribution. The longitudinal dependence of SEP intensity and spectral variations arise from the combined influence of 3D shock properties, magnetic connectivity, and particle transport processes. The agreement between in situ proton indices and relativistic DSA estimations supports DSA in this SEP event and provides insights into the early-stage acceleration at the source region."}

They are detected through variability of non-photospheric features with spectroscopy and/or asymmetric transits in time-series photometry. In the past four decades ~30 systems have shown such variations, and were therefore classified as exocomet host stars. However, some publications have pointed out mechanisms that might mimic exocometary features, and therefore, careful monitoring is needed to confirm the origin of the observed variability. With this paper we aim to investigate the exocomet nature of the non-photospheric variable features observed in the exocomet candidate stars HD 36546, HD 42111 and HD 85905. All of them have shown some degree of variability, particularly in their Ca II K line. We analysed the non-photospheric Ca II K line features from high-resolution spectra obtained using new NOT/FIES and Mercator/HERMES, and some additional archival spectra of the target stars. The variability was quantified through the changes in the equivalent widths of those features, which are assumed to be of circumstellar origin. Column densities were also estimated for each variable feature. Strong variability was found for HD 85905, consistent with a potential link to exocometary activity. However, the binarity of the system, which we confirmed through interferometric VLTI/PIONIER observations, complicates the interpretation of these signatures and prevents us from drawing definitive conclusions. The remaining two sources do not show any significant variability, but due to the sporadic nature of the exocometary events, we cannot discard the exocomet hypothesis. Further monitoring of the stars will be necessary to carry out a robust determination of the variability patterns and timescales that would completely rule out other scenarios."}

However, these methods lack dynamical validation on the main sequence due to the absence of eclipsing double-lined binary system (SB2) as benchmark objects. By providing the orbital inclination, astrometric binary systems from ESA Gaia DR3 offer an abundant alternative for eclipsing systems. We present KIC693187 as the first SB2, hosting a solar-like oscillating post-main-sequence star with dynamical masses. By combining Gaia astrometry with spectroscopic obtained with the Las Cumbres Observatory network (LCO), we find $M_1^\\mathrm{dyn}$=0.99$\\pm$0.05$M_\\odot$ and $M_2^\\mathrm{dyn}$=0.89$\\pm$0.04$M_\\odot$ for the primary and secondary, respectively. Asteroseismic parameters were extracted from photometry of the NASA \\Kepler satellite. The mass from individual frequency modeling is $M_1^\\mathrm{IF}$=0.92$\\pm$0.01$M_\\odot$. Taking into account the systematic uncertainty of 0.04$M_\\odot$ for best fit models from individual frequency fitting, we find an agreement within 1.2$σ$. From scaling relations we obtain a mass range of 0.93 to 0.98$M_\\odot$ by using the observed large frequency separations (\\dnu) in the scaling relations for the primary. By using standard corrections for departures from the asymptotic regime of \\dnu, we obtained a mass range of 0.83 to 1.03$M_\\odot$. The upper ends of both ranges agree well with the dynamical mass of the primary. This approach provides the first empirical validation for main-sequence solar-like oscillators and opens a new window for validating asteroseismology. Through a dedicatded program targeting astrometric SB2 binary systems, ESA's PLATO space mission will provide will enlarge the benchmark sample substantially."}

They have been used routinely, both outside and during eclipses, as sensitive probes of the electron density and polarization in the solar corona. Many novae pass through a coronal phase, wherein the highly ionized nova ejecta have physical conditions that are remarkably similar to those of the solar corona. Many of the coronal emission lines that are seen are common to the spectra of both the Sun and novae. Yet, it appears that no robust detection of the [Fe XIII] lines has been made in a nova. Here we report the detection of these two infrared [Fe XIII]lines in the spectrum of the recurrent nova V3890 Sgr, taken 23.43 and 31.35 days after its August 2019 outburst. From their line strengths, we derive values of 10^10 per cubic cm and 10^[8.5-9] per cubic cm for the electron density on the two. The decrease in density between epochs can be explained if the density decreased with a power law n ~ r**alpha with a alpha inferred to be -3. The average temperature of the coronal gas is estimated to be T = (2.51\\pm0.06) x 10^6~K.
