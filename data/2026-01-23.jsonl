Accepted for publication in ApJ", "summary": "We study the kinematics of condensations in 30 fields forming high-mass stars with ALMA at a high-resolution of ~0.08'' on average (~230 au). The presence of disks is important for feeding high-mass stars without feedback halting growth as their masses increase. In the search for velocity gradients resembling rotation that can reveal the presence of disks, we analyze the emission of gas tracers in 49 objects using CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CN, and tentative detections of HNCO and cis-HCOOH. Most of the velocity distributions show velocity gradients indicative of rotation. We reveal a total of 32 disk candidates, the largest sample to date that has been uniformly analyzed at a few hundred au scales in the high-mass regime. Their position-velocity maps are generally asymmetric with one side brighter than the opposite. We successfully fit a power law to the position-velocity maps of the disk candidates and find indices between -0.5 (Keplerian rotation) and -1 (rotation under specific angular momentum conservation) with a median of -0.7. Under Keplerian rotation assumption, we estimate central masses, uncorrected for inclination, ranging between 7 to 45 M$_\\odot$. Excluding outliers, the disk candidates are relatively more compact (<200 au) and less massive (<5 M$_\\odot$) than previous results at coarser angular resolution. We calculate an average Toomre-$Q$ parameter and find that most are gravitationally unstable (median of 0.5). We conclude that these observations offer the first opportunity to separate the disk and envelope components of hot cores on a statistically significant sample, and confirm that anisotropic collapse plays an role in feeding high-mass (proto)stars."}

Abstract abbreviated. Comments welcome!", "summary": "[Abbreviated] Context. Solar twins, stars whose stellar parameters (Teff, log g, and [M/H]) are very close to the Solar ones, offer a unique opportunity to investigate Galactic archaeology with very high accuracy and precision. However, most previous catalogs of Solar twins contain only a small number of objects (typically a few tens), and their selection functions are poorly characterized. Aims. We aim at building a large catalog of Solar twins from Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec, providing model-driven, rather than data-driven, stellar parameters including ages, together with a well-characterized selection function. Methods. Using stellar parameters from the Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec catalog, we selected Solar-twin candidates whose parameters lie within +- 200 K in Teff, +- 0.2 in log g, and +- 0.1 dex in [M/H] of the Solar values. Candidates unlikely to be genuine Solar twins were removed using Gaia flags and photometric constraints. We determined accurate ages for individual twins with a Bayesian isochrone-projection method, considering three combinations of parameters: Teff, [M/H], and either log g, M_G, or M_Ks. We also constructed a mock catalog to characterize the selection function. Results. Our final GSP-Spec Solar-twin catalog contains 6,594 stars. The mock catalog consisting of 75,588 artificial twins well reproduces the main characteristics of the observed catalog, especially for ages determined with M_G or M_Ks. To demonstrate the usefulness of our catalog, we compared chemical abundances [X/Fe] with age. We statistically confirmed the age--[X/Fe] relations for several species (e.g., Al, Si, Ca, and Y), demonstrating that trends previously identified in small but very high-precision samples persist in a much larger, independent sample. Conclusions. Our study bridges small high-precision Solar-twin samples and large data-driven ones, enabling demographic studies of Solar twins."}

In this paper we investigate a new approach to estimating ages for young populations, based on the well-founded assumption that the initial mass function is the same throughout a star forming cloud. We trial this method for six young clusters in the Perseus star forming region. For all six clusters, we construct new member samples in a homogeneous way using Gaia DR3. We estimate masses by comparing 2MASS photometry to theoretical isochrones, including Monte Carlo simulations to propagate the errors. We compare the mass distributions of the clusters for a range of plausible ages, looking for a combination of ages that results in indistinguishable mass distributions across the region. We find the best fit for ages of 1 Myr for NGC1333+Autochthe, 2 Myr for IC348, 2-3 Myr for Heleus, 3-4 Myr for Mestor, 4-5 Myr for Electryon+Cynurus, and 5-8 Myr for Alcaeus. All other combinations of ages are ruled out by this criterion. The established age sequence is consistent with the relative ages inferred from disc fractions, and broadly aligns with the age sequence determined in previous studies using isochrone fitting. We suggest that this approach can be a useful complement and cross-check to established methods to estimate ages in young populations."}

The circumstellar disc can arise as a result of, for example, mass transfer in a binary, while bipolar lobes can be the result of a violent pre-explosive ejection of matter, similar to the iconic cases of luminous blue variable stars (LBVs). We numerically simulate the radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) behaviour of interaction processes using a 2D cylindrical version of the RHD code CASTRO. We then calculate light curves, spectral patterns, and polarisation profiles, all up to a relatively long time of two years after an SN shock breakout and from different directions, using the multidimensional Monte Carlo radiation transfer (MC-RT) codes SEDONA and SIROCCO. We calculated a total of five models for the two aforementioned configurations of the surrounding CSM, for stratified density levels, comparing the simulated hydrodynamic behaviour and differences in their observable properties. RHD models exhibit similar behaviour to previous adiabatic models, but with a significantly slower expansion velocity. The calculated light curves show a relatively smooth evolution in SN-disc interaction, and declines and brightening in SN-lobes interaction. Comparing models with real events with a presumed similar physical process provides guidance for selecting a more accurate CSM configuration when simulating real situations."}

Most PCEBs studied to date have typical orbital periods of hours to a few days and can be well explained by assuming inefficient CEE to expel the envelope. However, there are currently several systems with relatively wide orbital periods ($>$18 days). To explain these wide PCEBs, additional sources of energy have been suggested to be taken into account. Here, we present the discovery and observational characterization of a compact object ($M\\,\\geq\\,0.58\\,\\rm M_{\\odot}$) with a K-type star companion in the solar neighborhood ($d\\sim 112$ pc) and an orbital period of $P_{\\rm orb}\\sim 14$ days.

Such a system with an orbital period within the gap between tight and wide binaries provides a test of whether additional energy sources are required to explain its formation. Using binary evolution models, we investigate the evolutionary history of this wide PCEB system and find that the observed properties of this source can be explained without invoking any extra energy source."}

In these systems, the less massive component exhibits a higher surface temperature than its more massive companion, which is a reversal of the typical A-type configuration, where the more massive star is hotter. This counterintuitive temperature inversion defies the basic stellar physics and still lacks a widely accepted explanation. In this study, we assembled a sample of over 3,000 extensively observed contact binaries and derived their complete set of physical parameters. Our statistical analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between the occurrence of W-type contact binaries and the intensity and frequency of magnetic activities. This result strongly supports the hypothesis that magnetic activities are the primary driver of the W-type phenomenon and offers a compelling explanation for the observed transitions between the W-type and A-type."}

It was observed in outburst in 1866 and 1946, with additional likely eruptions recorded in 1217 and 1787. Given its predicted recurrence period of approximately 80 yr, the next outburst is anticipated to occur imminently, thus motivating a thorough examination of the main characteristics of this system. We present new hydrodynamic models of the explosion of T CrB for different combinations of parameters (i.e., the mass, composition, and initial luminosity of the white dwarf, the metallicity of the accreted matter, and the mass-transfer rate). We show that mass-accretion rates between 10-8 - 10-7 Msun yr-1 are required to trigger an outburst after 80 yr of accretion of solar-composition material onto white dwarfs with masses about 1.30 - 1.38 Msun. For lower white dwarf luminosities, less massive white dwarfs, or reduced metallicity in the accreted material, higher mass-accretion rates are required to drive an explosion within this timescale. A decrease in metallicity or initial white dwarf luminosity leads to higher accumulated masses and ignition pressures, resulting in more violent outbursts. These outbursts exhibit higher peak temperatures, higher ejected masses, and greater kinetic energies. Models computed for different white dwarf masses but identical initial luminosities reveal significant differences in the elemental abundances of a wide range of species, including Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Ar, K, Ca, and Sc. These compositional differences offer a potential diagnostic tool for constraining the parameter space and discriminating between the various T CrB models reported in this study."}

To address this gap, a series of 3D smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations was conducted. These simulations explored the dynamic interactions between the nova ejecta, accretion disk, and stellar companion within the framework of the recurrent nova system U Sco. Notably, the simulations incorporate rotation around the system's center of mass. The primary goal of these simulations was to qualitatively examine the impact of various model parameters, including ejecta mass, velocity, and density, as well as the mass and geometry of the accretion disk. Simulations reveal complete disruption and sweeping of the accretion disk orbiting the white dwarf star for models with flared disks and Mejecta/Mdisk larger than 1. In contrast, V-shaped disks with a (constant) high initial density and Mejecta/Mdisk < 1 partially survive the impact with the nova ejecta. A very minor chemical contamination of the secondary star is anticipated in the U Sco case based on the limited impact of nova ejecta particles on the subgiant in all simulations. Minor mass ejection from the subgiant's outer layers is observed during the late-stage collision with ejecta and disk material, with some particles ejected from the binary system and some accreted by the white dwarf."}

We adopt the filament model proposed by Solov'ev (2010), in which a dense filament is supported against gravity by the repulsive force between the filament current and its sub-photospheric image. We first performed an analytical investigation of this model. For the numerical study, we use a two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model that solves the MHD equations with the Lare2d numerical code. Results: In this filament model, analytical expressions are derived for the electric current density, plasma density, and their spatial distributions as functions of the model parameters. The total electric current and the filament weight are also calculated. For the numerical simulations, we constructed an equilibrium filament characterized by a magnetic field of $B_0$ = $10^{-3}$ T, mass density $ρ_0$ ~ 1.3 x $10^{-9}$ kg m$^{-3}$, and temperature T ~ 13000 K. The system was destabilized either by increasing the currents or by reducing the filament density, and its evolution was computed. In both destabilization regimes, the filament was ejected, then halted at a certain altitude, and subsequently fell back, repeating this cycle with a period of about 600 s. The maximum filament ejection velocity was approximately 80 and 40 km $s^{-1}$, respectively. Beneath the ejected filament a current sheet forms, where magnetic reconnection occurs. The maximum ejection altitudes were determined as functions of both the destabilizing currents and the degree of filament plasma dilution. Finally, we compared results of this MHD model with those of an ideal vacuum model and discussed all results."}

An investigation into activity-induced variations of the O I infrared triplet", "comment": "Accepted as a letter in A&A. 5 pages, 5 figures, 1 table", "summary": "The determination of the solar oxygen abundance remains a central problem in astrophysics, as its accuracy is limited not only by models but also by systematics. While many of these factors have been thoroughly characterized, the effect of the solar activity cycle has so far remained unexplored. Due to its relative strength and accessibility, the O I infrared triplet is typically the primary choice for abundance studies. However, previous investigations have shown that abundances inferred from this triplet tend to be higher than expected on active stars, whereas such an overabundance effect is not observed for the much weaker forbidden O I 6300 Å line. This raises the question of whether a similar trend can be found for the Sun. To address this question, we analyze two decades' worth of synoptic disk-integrated Sun-as-a-star datasets from the FEROS, HARPS-N, PEPSI, and NEID spectrographs, focusing on the infrared triplet (7772, 7774, 7775 Å) and the forbidden O I 6300 Å line. The excellent signal-to-noise ratio of the PEPSI observations allows us to detect a weak but significant variation in the equivalent widths of the infrared triplet, corresponding to about 0.01 dex difference in abundance between activity minimum and maximum. This value is significantly smaller than the typical uncertainties on the solar oxygen abundance. Due to higher scatter, no comparable trend is found in the other data sets. Based on these results, we conclude that within the typical uncertainties presented in other works, we can assume the inferred solar oxygen abundance to be stable across the solar cycle, but that this effect may be significant for other, more active stars."}

This period includes one extreme solar event of 774 CE and one Grand solar minimum of 650-730 CE. We could identify 91 solar cycles, of which 26 were well-defined, while 24 and 41 were reasonably and poorly defined, respectively. The mean cycle length was 10.6 years, but the lengths of individual cycles vary between 8 and 15 years. The existence of empirical Waldmeier's relations remains inconclusive. No significant periodicities were found beyond the 11-year cycle. Conclusions. This work fills the gap in the solar cycle statistics between the previously reconstructed first millennium BCE and the second millennium CE, providing vital constraints for the solar dynamo and irradiance models. A consistent 3-millennium-long reconstruction of sunspot numbers, based on a composite multi-proxy cosmogenic record, is pending."}
